# CIFAR-10 VGG-16 Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the **VGG-16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** on the **CIFAR-10** dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, with 50,000 for training and 10,000 for testing.

## Project Overview
The project demonstrates the training of the VGG-16 model for image classification tasks using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Files
- **`cifar10.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook for model training and evaluation.
- **`cifar10_vgg_model.keras`**: Saved trained model.
- **`model_visualization.png`**: Visualization of the VGG-16 architecture.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aamohmd/CIFAR-10.git

## Usage

Run the notebook cifar10.ipynb to train and evaluate the model.
## Results

The model achieves good accuracy on the CIFAR-10 test set after training.
